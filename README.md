# ANSI Escape Sequences

My attempt to write a simple library in C to make writing ANSI escape sequences easy.
I'm sorry for the use of gotos.

This library provides functions for printing single escape sequences, colored output, formatted colored output and move the cursor around

Not all the cursor control sequences were implemented
All the other escape sequences were not implemented
